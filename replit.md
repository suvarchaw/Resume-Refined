# System Architecture

## Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

## Frontend Architecture
The client application is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: Extensive use of Radix UI primitives wrapped in custom shadcn/ui components
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, featuring a dark space theme
- **Component Structure**: Organized into reusable UI components and page-specific components
- **Custom Components**: Specialized components like `MagicBento`, `CosmicProgress`, `GalaxyBackground`, and `SplitText` for enhanced visual effects
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: GSAP for complex animations and CSS transitions for basic interactions

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a modular Express.js architecture:

- **Route Structure**: Centralized route registration in `routes.ts`
- **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface (`IStorage`) with in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`)
- **Service Layer**: OpenAI integration service for AI-powered resume analysis
- **Middleware**: Request logging, error handling, and body parsing
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot module reloading in development

## Database Design
Using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations:

- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **Resume Analyses Table**: Stores analysis results with JSON feedback structure
